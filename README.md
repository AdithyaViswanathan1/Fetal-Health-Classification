- fetal_health: | 1 - Normal | 2 - Suspect | 3 - Pathological |

## Objectives

The main objective of this project is:
> Develop a system to detect abnormal fetal health in order to reduce child-under-5 mortality, especially in low-resource countries.

To achieve the main objective, here are sub-objectives:
1. Perform extensive exploratory data analysis of tabular data.
2. Perform feature selection to extract only the most important predictors.
3. Develop supervised machine learning approach to classify fetal health into 3 states.
4. Determine threshold to achieve best results in a medical setting.
5. Deploy model (if time permits)
